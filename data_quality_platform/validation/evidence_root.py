"""Tamper-Evident Evidence Root (DQAVP enterprise hardening, Section 17).

An ADDITIVE integrity layer on top of the existing evidence format
(which is unchanged): for a given evidence directory, compute SHA-256
for each core evidence artifact

    manifest.json / output / lineage.json / audit.json /
    monitoring.json / alerts.json

and derive a deterministic root hash over the artifact-hash set. The
root is written to ``evidence_root.json`` inside the directory.

Verification recomputes everything from the actual files and compares
against the recorded root: changing ANY covered artifact (or adding/
removing one) invalidates the evidence root — FAIL CLOSED.

Guarantees and limits (explicit, no overstatement):
- The root binds the artifacts listed in the root record at creation
  time, identified by fixed logical names.
- The output CSV is covered only when it resides inside the evidence
  directory at creation time; if absent it is recorded as ``absent``
  (never silently skipped).
- This layer does not replace the existing manifest format or the
  evidence validator; it adds tamper-evidence on top of them.
